<h1 align=center><b>Hi âœ¨</b></h1>
<p align=center>I'm not active on GitHub because it's owned by Microsoft, has Copilot and I want my own stuff on my own server.</p>
<p align=center>If you want to see what I'm doing, head over to <a href="https://git.staropensource.de/JeremyStarTM">sos!git</a>.</p>
